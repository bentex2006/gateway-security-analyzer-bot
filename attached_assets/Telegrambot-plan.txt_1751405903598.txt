"I want a Telegram bot made with Python that listens for commands like /url <site> and checks the provided website URL for various security and technology details. The bot should:

 

✅ Detect if the website is using Cloudflare by analyzing HTTP response headers (e.g., presence of cf-ray, cf-cache-status, server: cloudflare, etc.)

 

✅ Detect if the website uses any type of CAPTCHA, such as Google reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, or other common CAPTCHA systems, by scanning the HTML for known scripts, iframe sources, or keywords related to CAPTCHA

 

✅ Detect if the site has a GraphQL endpoint by probing common paths (like /graphql) and checking if it responds without 404

 

✅ Identify if the site is powered by WordPress or WooCommerce by inspecting meta tags, HTML code patterns (e.g., wp-content, woocommerce strings), or headers

 

✅ Check for the presence of common security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and report whether they are set or missing

 

✅ Optionally detect if a payment system is present and what type it is

 

 

 

The bot should use Python libraries like python-telegram-bot, requests, and BeautifulSoup to perform these checks, and optionally integrate with external APIs like Wappalyzer or BuiltWith for deeper technology detection.

 

The bot should be fast, reliable, handle errors gracefully (e.g., timeouts, invalid URLs), and return results to the user in a clean, readable message.

add /approve userid to allow User to use my bot and also in group if I use /groupuse off/no that in that group I used this command everyone can use it Approve will be bypassed

I want the bot code to be structured, easy to extend (so I can add more checks later), and ready to deploy on a VPS using webhook or polling. Please generate production-quality Python code for this Telegram bot."
